# 🎯 Reward Distribution Update - 20% Analyst / 80% Staker

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Type:** UI/UX Content Update
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## 📝 Summary

Updated all frontend UI text and visualizations to reflect **20% Analyst / 80% Staker** reward distribution split across the entire application.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This is **UI-only update**. The smart contract still implements proportional split (all winners share equally by stake amount). These UI changes prepare for future v2 contract upgrade.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Smart Contract Status
**Current Contract Behavior:**
- Implements **proportional split** (all winners share equally by stake amount)
- NO separate analyst/staker percentage split
- All winning stakers (including creator) get equal ROI

**UI vs Contract Mismatch:**
- UI now shows 20/80 split (future v2 behavior)
- Contract implements equal proportional split (current v1 behavior)
- `usePoolStaking.ts` calculation already updated to match contract (see previous update)

### When Contract Implements 20/80 Split
The contract will need these changes:
```solidity
// Future v2 implementation needed in StakingPool.sol
function calculateRewards(...) {
    if (user == poolCreator) {
        reward = losingPool * 20 / 100;  // 20% to analyst
    } else {
        uint256 stakersPool = losingPool * 80 / 100;  // 80% to stakers
        reward = (userStake * stakersPool) / totalStakersAmount;
    }
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Changes
1. **Distribution Bar**
   - Was: `[30% blue | 70% orange]`
   - Now: `[80% blue | 20% orange]`
   - More prominent blue section emphasizes staker rewards

2. **Metric Cards**
   - Clearer labeling: "You (analyst) earn"
   - Emphasizes role-based rewards

3. **Descriptions**
   - Simplified language
   - Removed confusing "50% + 20%" breakdown
   - Direct "20% to analysts" messaging

## 🔄 Future Migration Plan

When deploying v2 contracts with 20/80 split:

### Step 1: Deploy Updated Contracts
```bash
# Update StakingPool.sol with 20/80 logic
# Redeploy all contracts
cd sc
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:DeployScript --broadcast --verify
```

### Step 2: Update Frontend Config
```bash
# Update contract addresses in .env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STAKINGPOOL_ADDRESS=0x... # new address
```

### Step 3: Update Calculation Hook (Already Done!)
✅ `usePoolStaking.ts` already has v2-ready comments
✅ Just uncomment v2 logic when contract is ready

### Step 4: Test End-to-End
- Create pool → Stake → Resolve → Claim
- Verify 20% goes to analyst
- Verify 80% split among stakers
