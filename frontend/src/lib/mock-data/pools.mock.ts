 * MOCK POOLS DATA - UPDATED FOR OCT 2025
 *
 * This file contains mock data for POOL entities with 20/80 reward split logic:
 * - Creator gets 20% of remaining pool (after 2% fee)
 * - Winning stakers get 80% of remaining pool
 * - Creator excluded from staker pool calculations
 * - Rewards auto-distributed on resolution
 *
 * Contract Integration Point:
 * - Replace with: await readContract({ address: poolFactory, functionName: 'getPoolsByNews', args: [newsId] })
 * - Map contract struct to Pool interface (see types/index.ts)
